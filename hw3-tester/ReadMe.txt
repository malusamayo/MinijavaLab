=========================================
Test Script for Homework 3

IMPORTANT: The grader is going to test your program on the SEASNet Unix
server machines (ugrad.seas.ucla.edu).  Be sure you run this script on
those machines before submitting.

If you encounter any problems, e-mail <kgo@ucla.edu>.

1. Tar up your source code into "hw3.tgz"
  - All your files should be in a subdirectory named "hw3".
  - DO NOT include ".class" files.
  - DO NOT include the JavaCC grammar file
  - DO NOT include any files generated by JavaCC or JTB.
  - If you have comments for the grader, put it in a file called
    "hw3/ReadMe.txt".  That is the only non-Java file allowed.

2. Execute the "run" script (located in the same directory as this ReadMe
   file) and give it the path to your "hw3.tgz" file:

      # ./run SelfTestCases ../hw3.tgz

   This will compile and run your program on all the tests in the
	"SelfTestCases/" directory.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you delete the "Output/" directory before giving this
script to someone else.  The "Output/" directory contains all the test
results as well as an unzipped copy of your entire homework submission!

If you want, you can add more tests to the "SelfTestCases/" sub-directory.
